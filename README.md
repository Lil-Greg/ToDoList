> I want to:
>
> > 1.  Change the schema for my toDo stuff to make it an empty array and put toDo ids of all of the toDos one owns inside of there.
>
> > 2.  Change the way passwords are saved in the database because, right now, they are being saved as straight text and I want to add some security to that (by hashing the text).
>
> > 3.  Signing up (registering) works, but I want to add the functionality like the input errors and stuff. Some progress bars would be nice as well.
>
> > 4.  I want to make the entire site look better, maybe add a theme context where users can choose their theme and the defaul is based on their browser/computer settings (or however websites do it).
